Scene 3: Heartbeats and Warning Calls
Author: GPT-4.1

[Deep within the jungle’s tangled heart, dusky sunset light filters through enormous leaves. LUCIAN and SANDRA, breathless but exhilarated, navigate a mossy stone staircase, half-swallowed by roots and vines.]

LUCIAN (gently, offering his hand):  
This place remembers every footstep,  
Every dream that once passed by…  
But you, Sandra, are the bravest vision  
Ever to trouble this ancient sky.

[SANDRA laughs softly and takes his hand, scanning the faded symbols carved into the stone walls.]

SANDRA (singing):  
It is not courage, Lucian—only longing,  
A wish for stories old and new.  
Yet my heart, it pounds like jungle thunder  
Each time I look at you.

[He blushes, enchanted.]

LUCIAN:  
The monkeys in the canopies sing to us—  
(He whistles; from above, the faint chatter of monkeys echoes back.)  
They are composing a sonnet for our quest,  
A serenade of leaf and dusk.

[SANDRA smiles, but her eyes are wary.]

SANDRA:  
But have you felt—since we joined—  
A shadow keeping pace?  
The jungle’s quiet isn’t empty;  
Our path is trailed by a silent face.

[Suddenly, the vines nearby tremble, and a mechanical whir builds in the background. Offstage, a faint echo: the opening bars of "La donna è mobile" sung with inhuman precision.]

LUCIAN (half-whisper, drawing her close):  
That is no mynah bird.  
That song is wound of gears and metal—  
The Baritone! His specter nears.

[They hide behind a toppled pillar as spotlights sweep the undergrowth in vivid red and gold. The faint light glances over Sandra’s determined face.]

SANDRA (singing with fire):  
We will not turn, Lucian—no,  
This city’s promise waits ahead.  
Let robot arias haunt my shadow—  
Let government threats inspire dread.

LUCIAN (gripping her hand):  
Together, as roots entwine the past,  
We’ll outwit the singer and his iron beast.  
Trust in love, in song, in the jungle vast—  
For soon the lost city will rise in the east!

[They dart offstage, hand in hand, as the distant aria grows louder: the chase is on.]

[Scene ends with a shimmering chord of hope, punctuated by ominous mechanical footsteps.]
