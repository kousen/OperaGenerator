Scene 4: The Mechanical Pursuit
Author: Claude Sonnet 4

[A moonlit glade where ancient Connecticut highway signs peek through flowering vines. "HARTFORD - 5 MILES" reads one, half-covered in luminescent moss. The ROBOT crashes through the undergrowth, its red eyes scanning methodically. MAXIMILIAN follows, breathing heavily.]

MAXIMILIAN (singing with growing frustration):
They slip through shadows like the wind,
These lovers drunk on foolish dreams!
But every step brings them closer to
Hartford's forbidden schemes.

[The ROBOT stops, head tilting as it analyzes the ground.]

ROBOT (in mechanical English):
*Footprints detected. Two subjects.
Trail leads northeast, toward the ruins.*

MAXIMILIAN (pleased):
Excellent! Now demonstrate your range—
Let German opera shake these trees!
Perhaps Wagner's might will make them change
Their minds about what no one sees.

[The ROBOT's chest cavity opens, revealing glowing speakers. It begins a thunderous rendition of the "Ride of the Valkyries."]

ROBOT (singing in German):
*"Hojotoho! Hojotoho!
Heiaha! Heiaha!"*

[The jungle trembles; exotic birds screech and flee. Somewhere in the distance, Sandra's voice can be heard, defiant.]

SANDRA (offstage, echoing):
Your iron songbird cannot frighten
Hearts that beat as one!

MAXIMILIAN (snarling):
She mocks my mechanized soprano!
This calls for stronger measures still.
Aria-7, prepare the Verdi sequence—
"Dies Irae" with killing skill!

[The ROBOT's voice shifts to a haunting, operatic bass that seems to make the very air shiver.]

ROBOT (singing ominously):
*"Dies irae, dies illa,
Solvet saeclum in favilla..."*
[Day of wrath, that day
Will dissolve the world in ashes...]

MAXIMILIAN (with dark satisfaction):
Now they'll learn what power means—
When government and art combine!
No love story ends well
When it threatens the design!

[He draws a high-tech device from his coat, its screen glowing with tracking signals.]

MAXIMILIAN (final verse):
The city's heart holds secrets dark,
From before the waters rose.
If they wake what Hartford hides,
The world's brief peace will close!
So hunt them down, my metal friend,
Let opera be their requiem—
For duty calls, and I must end
This jungle's love poem!

[Thunder crashes as man and machine stride deeper into the night, the ROBOT's arias echoing through the trees like a metallic storm.]

[Lights fade to cold blue.]
