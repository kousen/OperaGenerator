Scene 2: The Agent's Oath
Author: Claude Sonnet 4

[A metallic clearing in the jungle, where twisted steel beams from old infrastructure jut through the greenery. Center stage stands MAXIMILIAN VOSS (baritone), a stern man in a dark uniform, speaking into a communications device. Behind him looms his GIANT ROBOT, a towering mechanical figure with glowing red eyes, currently in standby mode.]

MAXIMILIAN (singing in commanding tones):
Command, I have her trail at last,
The explorer seeks what must stay buried.
Hartford's secrets from the past
Must not be by civilians carried!

[He snaps the device shut and turns to address his robot.]

MAXIMILIAN (continuing):
Aria-7, my steel companion,
Your circuits hum with Verdi's fire.
When mortals hear your song's dominion,
They'll flee before your mechanical choir!

[The ROBOT's eyes glow brighter as it activates, its voice a booming mechanical bass that somehow carries melody.]

ROBOT (singing in Italian):
*"La donna è mobile, qual piuma al vento..."*
[Woman is fickle, like a feather in the wind...]

MAXIMILIAN (pleased):
Excellent! Your Italian grows more perfect.
Now ready your German repertoire—
Should the poet prove too bold to deflect,
Unleash Wagner's thunder from afar!

[The ROBOT switches to German, its voice now a thunderous baritone.]

ROBOT (singing):
*"Wotan's rage shall shake the earth,
Die Walküre rides again!"*

MAXIMILIAN (with growing intensity):
They think love conquers all of worth,
But I am Hartford's guardian!
No romance shall unlock the door
To secrets that could doom us all—
The city's core holds so much more
Than ruins from before the fall!

[He strides forward, his voice rising with determination.]

MAXIMILIAN (final aria):
Let them sing of hearts entwined,
Let them dream of paradise found—
But I shall bind what they'd unbind,
And silence love's defiant sound!
For duty calls, and I must answer,
Though beauty pleads and poets cry.
I am the government's dark dancer,
And Hartford's truth must never fly!

[Thunder rumbles as both man and machine prepare to hunt. The ROBOT's eyes sweep the jungle like searchlights as they march into the green depths.]

[Lights fade to ominous red.]
