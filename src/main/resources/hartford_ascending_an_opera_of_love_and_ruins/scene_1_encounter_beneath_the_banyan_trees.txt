Scene 1: Encounter Beneath the Banyan Trees
Author: GPT-4.1

[The stage is lush and green, tangled with vines and enormous leaves. Birds call from above, and shafts of golden sunlight pierce the green gloom. The explorer SANDRA (soprano) hacks through the undergrowth, sweat on her brow, map in hand.]

SANDRA (singing):  
What verdant wall impedes my quest,  
Each fragrant root, each echoing cry?  
Oh, Hartford, cradle of dreams long lost,  
Still you elude me: but I will not rest—  
Until my compass spins no more,  
Until your marble halls I spy!

[Enter LUCIAN (tenor), his hair entwined with flowers, carrying a battered notebook. He stops, startled, hearing Sandra’s voice. He steps forward.]

LUCIAN (singing):  
A human voice in this cathedral wild?  
Not echo, not shadow, not bird—a soul!  
O muse, what brings you to my emerald exile?  
Did the flowers summon you, or the thunder roll?

[Sandra lowers her machete, surprised and wary.]

SANDRA:  
Who are you, spirit or man?  
Show yourself, for I am Sandra Greaves!  
Explorer, dreamer, Hartford's seeker,  
Lost not in fear, but in tangled leaves.

LUCIAN (bowing):  
I am Lucian. Here I dwell,  
My poetry roots and grows so deep.  
I know these trails and secret wells—  
Yet you, fair stranger, pierce my sleep.

[They circle each other warily, curiosity drawing them closer.]

SANDRA:  
Can you guide me, gentle poet?  
Can you read the paths that twist and wind?  
The city calls from memory’s moat—  
Will you be the heart I find?

LUCIAN:  
For you, brave spirit, I would brave  
The fanged orchids and the haunted stone.  
Together we will seek what secrets save,  
In lost Hartford, we find our own.

[They clasp hands, their voices blending in a hopeful duet as the jungle seems to pulse with new energy—just as, offstage, there is a distant mechanical rumble: the warning of impending trouble.]

[Lights dim.]
